<h1>Automations in ModbusPal</h1>

<p>The registers and coils defined in the slaves of the project will become
    dynamic by binding them to value generators, called <q>automations</q>.
    Using automations will turn simple projects into realistic simulations.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>An <q>automation</q> is made of a succession of <q>generators</q>.
    Each generator is a formula that produces a dynamic value.
    A generator is executed for a limited duration, and then the next
    generator is used to continue producing the dynamic value.</p>

<p>For example, consider the following requirements:
    <img alt="A specification for an automation" class="img-stand-alone" src="img/a_spec_for_automation.jpg"
         title="Spec"/>
    The above graph is made of 3 segments. It can be simulated by using
    3 linear generators:
    <img alt="Implementation graph" class="img-stand-alone" src="img/a_spec_for_automation_2.jpg" title="Spec"/>
    Additionally, the <q>Loop</q> option can be enabled so that the automation
    restarts from the beginning when its end is reached. Otherwise, it would stop.</p>

<h2>Creating an automation</h2>

<p>Clicking on the <q>Add</q> button in the <q>Automation</q> panel creates
    a new automation in the current project. The new automation is instantly
    added into the list. It contains no generator, and thus cannot generate
    a dynamic value, yet.
    <img alt="View of an automation panel" class="img-stand-alone" src="img/view_of_automation_panel.jpg"
         title="Automation panel"/>
</p>

<h2>Automationâ€™s name</h2>

<p>It is very important that each automation in the project has a unique
    name. The name of the automation is what ModbusPal uses to create the
    association with the registers/coils of the MODBUS slaves.</p>

<p>The name of the automation can be changed, but if the new name is
    identical to the name of another existing automation, an error message
    will appear.</p>


<h2>Editing an automation</h2>

<p>Click on the
    <q><img alt="Show" class="img-inline" src="../automation/img/show.png" title="Show"/></q>
    button to open the automation editor. Information about how to edit an
    automation can be found in
    <a href="edit-automation.html">this page</a>.</p>

<h2>Delete automation</h2>

<p>Clicking on the
    <q><img alt="Delete" class="img-inline" src="../automation/img/delete.png" title="Delete"/></q>
    button will remove an automation from the current project.</p>

<div class="notes">
    <h3>Note</h3>
    <p>Any association between the removed automation and the MODBUS
        slaves will also be deleted.</p>
</div>

<h2>Binding automation</h2>

<p>Bindings are required to associate automations and MODBUS slaves. Refer
    to the information on
    <a href="bindings-overview.html">this page</a>
    to learn about bindings and how to create them.</p>

<h2>Executing automations</h2>

<p>When a project file is loaded, or when new automations are created,
    automations are stopped and do not generate dynamic values. They have to
    be started.</p>

<p>An automation is started by clicking on its
    <q><img alt="Start" class="img-inline" src="../automation/img/play.png" title="Start"/></q>
    button. It will stop automatically when its finished generating values,
    except if the <q>Loop</q> option has been activated in the editor. An
    automation can be stopped at any time by clicking on the
    <q><img alt="Stop" class="img-inline" src="../automation/img/stop.png" title="Stop"/></q>
    button.</p>

<p>All automations can be started and stopped at once by clicking on the
    <q>Start all</q> or the <q>Stop all</q> buttons.</p>
