      <h1>Adding MODBUS RTU slaves</h1>

      <h2>Regular MODBUS RTU addressing</h2>
      
      <p>When using Serial Link, MODBUS slaves are identified by a unique
      number, whose value is comprised between 1 and 247.</p>

      <p>New MODBUS RTU slaves can be created by using one of the
      following patterns:</p>
      
      <dl>
          <dt>1</dt>
          <dd>Create just one slave with address 1.</dd>
          <dt>5-10</dt>
          <dd>Create all six slaves with addresses ranging from 5 to 10 included.</dd>
          <dt>6, 12</dt>
          <dd>Create two slaves, the first with address 6 and the second with
          address 12.</dd>
          <dt>5, 8-10, 12</dt>
          <dd>Create slaves with addresses 5, 8, 9, 10 and 12.</dd>
      </dl>
      
      <p>Note: the comma can be replaced by a new line. White 
      spaces following the comma are ignored.</p>

      <h2>MODBUS RTU slaves behind a MODBUS TCP gateway</h2>
      
      <p>ModbusPal can emulate MODBUS RTU devices as if they were behind
          a MODBUS TCP gateway.</p>
      
      <p>Such MODBUS slaves must be identified by both an IP address and a slave
      number, and can be created by using one of the
      following patterns:</p>
      
      <dl>
          <dt>127.0.0.1(17)</dt>
          <dd>Create juste one slave at IP address 127.0.0.1 (listen on all
          network interfaces) and slave number 17.</dd>
          <dt>192.168.10.100(10-15)</dt>
          <dd>Create 6 slaves sharing the same IP address (local network interface
          192.168.10.100). Each slave is assigned a slave number ranging from 10
          to 15 included.</dd>
      </dl>
